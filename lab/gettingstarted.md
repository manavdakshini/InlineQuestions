# Getting Started With Microsoft Hyper-V

## Overview

Hyper-V is Microsoft's hardware virtualization product. It allows you to create and run a software version of a computer, called a virtual machine. Each virtual machine acts like a complete computer, running an operating system and programs. Hyper-V runs as a Type 1 hypervisor, making it one of the most efficient and effective ways to manage virtual machines.

## System Requirements

Hyper-V is available on Windows 10 Professional, Enterprise, and Education editions, but not on Home edition. It is also a feature in Windows Server editions from Windows Server 2008 onward.

Hyper-V installation requires CPUs that support Second Level Address Translation (SLAT), also known as Extended Page Tables (EPT) in Intel processors or Nested Page Tables (NPT) in AMD processors. SLAT helps improve the efficiency of memory use in virtual environments.

## Hyper-V Features

Hyper-V includes three types of virtual switches: External, Internal, and Private. These virtual switches allow virtual machines to communicate with each other and with external networks, providing flexible networking configurations that can be tailored to various deployment needs.

Live Migration is a feature in Hyper-V that enables you to move running virtual machines from one physical server to another with no downtime, maintaining continuous service availability and load balancing. This is particularly crucial in maintaining high availability and managing dynamic workloads in enterprise environments.

Failover Clustering is a key feature in Hyper-V that enhances the reliability and availability of applications. It involves connecting multiple servers in a cluster, which can then provide high availability by automatically restarting applications on another node if one fails.
